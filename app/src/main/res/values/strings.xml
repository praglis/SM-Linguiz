    </string>
    <string name="app_desc_p3">
        In the learn mode you have to guess a word meaning being provided four possible answers, while only one of them is correct.
        After you choose an answer, you are being informed about the answer\'s correctness.
        You can specify of how many questions will your learning session consist.
        Every time you answer correctly or make mistake the app will remember this.
        In future learning sessions more problematic words will appear more frequently.
</string>
    <string name="app_desc_p4">
        The test mode is similar to the learn mode with main difference - you can\'t skip questions, and you aren\'t able to see your result until the end of the test.
        Additionally, this mode does not remember if you guessed correctly meaning of certain word, but it saves your test score and enables to view it later.
